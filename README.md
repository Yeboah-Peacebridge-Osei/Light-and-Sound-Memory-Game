Submitted by: **Yeboah Peacebridge Osei**

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- [ ] Improve the game to allow users to be able to create a profile(sign up or log in)
- [ ] There should be a memory improvement update that informs users on the improvements they are making in being able to know which button the computer suggested.
- [ ] Users should be able to share their improvement and succes on other social media handles to invite people to play the game too.



## Video Walkthrough (GIF)

I recorded a full gif to cover all the implemented features, including messages and everything. Linked below

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[ The only resource I used is the walkthrough from the pre-work]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I made a couple of case-sensitive mistakes in the code, but I used console.log to get down to the mistakes
I made a mistake while writing the guess function but I compared to the solution that was provided and corrected the mistakes ]


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[The question this pre-work made me ask myself is how many very useful programs can we combine html, css and javascript to build. If we could create a memory enhancing game from web development, then I cannot imagine other very useful things we can create too.  ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I will spend them looking into how I can add a feature that assign scores to users and not just tell them they won or lost. 
This way, the user will know how well they did.
I will also look into how I can implement a score keeper or memory improvement recorder that updates users on how well they did in their previous try and the recent try.]
